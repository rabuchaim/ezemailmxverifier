# ezemailmxverifier v0.9.0beta1 for testing
EzEmailMXVerifier is a fast and pure Python lib to validate email addresses. It checks syntax, domain, TLD, MX and resolves IPs. It uses its own cache, has a built-in DNS client (with configurable fallback, timeout and retries), details failures (translatable) and has extra functions. No external dependencies, it's pure Python!
